This project is a 3D rendering system for application in game creation.
As of now it can fully render 3D objects, and has basic camera functionalities. 
In the future we hope to also implement more functionalities such as more camera options, more mesh objects, texture systems, collision systems, and more options.

This project is not recommended for serious projects as of now, but will eventually be patched up and made into a fully usable system.
